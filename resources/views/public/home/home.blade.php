                <p> Keeping pace with very fast developing technology of today and considering the technical superiority
                    and economical benefits, we have opted for the construction of higher capacity of fossil fuel power
                    plants, with most advanced state-of-the-art control device for reliable sustainable and efficient
                    operation and safety of this power plant, we need a team of properly trained and skilled human
                    resource.
                </p>
                <h4>Why Simulator?</h4>
                <p>Conventional on the job training does have some constraints and found deficient to develop the true
                    skill of an operator, whereas, simulator trainings have proved to be an effective training tool,
                    since it gives a feeling of operating a real power plant with no fuel cost, no wastage of time and
                    no losses or repairs. The operators gain quickly hands-onâ€”experience both for normal and
                    abnormal/emergency operation of the plant. A simulator trained operator reduces the downtime
                    significantly and runs the plant safely and efficiently.

                <h4>BKTPP Simulator</h4>
                <p>Installed in 2002 by GSE Power System Inc., USA, BKTPP Training Simulator has conducted countless
                    training sessions to cater various needs of different organizations of national and international
                    repute.
                </p>
                <p>Situated inside the BKTPP Township premise, the main feature of the simulator are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Full size replica of control room</li>
                    <li>Workstation computers as soft panel</li>
                    <li>Conventional hard panel</li>
                    <li>PLC for interfacing between soft and hard panel</li>
                    <li>Field device terminal</li>
                    <li>Instructor station</li>
                </ul>
